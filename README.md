# CP386 Assignment 4
**Multithreaded Banker's Algorithm**

## Motivation
The course concepts demonstrated with the implementation of this algorithm are extremely useful in many real-world scenarios. Deciding whether threads are safe to proceed and avoiding deadlock is essential to success with threading.

## Installation
Clone the repository via the .git URL into a desired folder. Once the repository has finished cloning, run the make file by entering the following command into your Bash shell: `make run`. The shell will execute the program and allow the user to interact.

## Individual Contribution
Some initial functions were written by Alexander Francis and were replaced along with more functions additions by Prit Patel.


## Features
- Variable number of clients
- Guaranteed thread resource safety
- Interactive terminal for custom request and release input
- Data structure view at any point during execution

## Test Cases


## Use Examples
Any situation where threads require multiple types and amounts of different system resources can implement the banker's algorithm in order to ensure that no threads are left waiting for resources indefinitely.
